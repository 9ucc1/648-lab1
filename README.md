# EAS648 (Advanced Geovisualization) Lab 1

The purpose of this lab is to generate a RMD (R Markdown file) displaying a chart and map created using R. I chose to generate a map of elevation in the Phoenix area, northeast of downtown, to include areas of the Tonto National Forest.

Data for this Phoenix elevation map was sourced from USGS. The link for information, metadata, and download can be found [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/660df8f6d34ededd8cd8247f).
